#### üó≥Ô∏è ERC721g - GNFT

Building upon the foundation of ERC721, BeArt introduces the ERC721g standard, incorporating additional fixed module tags focused on supporting art-related RWA (Real World Asset) assets. 

#### üîç CATALOGUE System

The CATALOGUE System introduced by BeArt represents a patented technology focused on achieving a 100% genuine on-chain mapping of art RWA assets, akin to a "minting system" for artistic assets.

#### ‚úÖ RWA Asset Standard

The RWA asset standard promoted by BeArt adopts a range of advanced techniques, including optical scanning, image recognition, 3D modeling, photogrammetry, and detailed material and color analysis. These technologies work together to create an accurate, micron-level genetic image and dataset that not only records basic artwork sequences but also provides a detailed display of its three-dimensional structure.
